# General LeapFrog game research
A repository for posting documents and code for helping people with converting, extracting, viewing and maybe even modding data for games on LeapFrog devices

# Who can contribute?
Anyone! Just don't make stuff up or intentionally add misleading/false information. Works in progress are allowed.

# Is it okay to document formats on non-LeapFrog platforms here?
Yes, but only if the games/programs they're from largely use the same engine as a LeapFrog game. 

VTech is allowed too, but only because they own LeapFrog and have released games on LeapFrog products. 

This is strictly limited to their educational handhelds though.
