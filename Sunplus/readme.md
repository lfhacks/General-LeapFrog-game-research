# Sunplus
This section is specifically for common formats on SPG/SPC-based LeapFrog products. This includes Generalplus stuff too.

LeapFrog started using SPG-based hardware before the Didj came out and the formats they used on them have remained mostly the same over the years.

Format list:

- A16 (Sunplus A1600 Codec)
- S72 (Sunplus S720 Codec)
- A18 (Generalplus A1800 Codec)
- SunMIDI

You'll need to get the algorithm libraries from the [Generalplus Gadget Utility](http://www.generalplus.com/1LVlangLNxxSVyySNservice_n_support_d) to use the conversion script.

Your Python version also has to be 32-Bit.

Special thanks to the Furby hacking community for figuring out how to use the A1800 codec!

### What devices does this include?
- A *ton* of toys (a lot of which such as a Mr. Pencil toy have easily dumpable ROMs - this needs to be looked into further)
- ClickStart: My First Computer
- Fly Pentop Computer (needs to be confirmed, likely the same hardware as the Tag Reader)
- Tag Reader
- Tag Jr
- LeapReader
- My Own Leaptop (again, needs confirmation)
- LeapStart
- LeapStart 3D
- Magic Adventures Globe (needs confirmation, system software seems similar to the LeapStart/LeapReader though)


### Is there any non-LeapFrog stuff that used these?
Yes. There's a lot, actually. Too much to list here. I'll list a few though:

- A lot of cheap SPG2xx-based game systems from 2006 onwards
- Almost any affordable yet advanced toy from 2006 onwards used Sunplus hardware
- Furby Connect
- JAKKS Pacific Plug it in and Play TV Games
- RoboPanda
- Tickle Me Elmo (someone decapped the chip on this one)
- VTech V.Smile
